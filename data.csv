"Portugal played phenomenally. They got the ball, made the correct passes, and scored beautifully. Beyond that, Cristiano Ronaldo was a star. He was amazing this game. From the first penalty goal to the last free kick goal, he carried his team and boosted their confidence. Ultimately, a very nice job and a very nice match.","Brazil's performance against Switzerland today was disappointing. They weren't able to break the Swiss defense and took the game too lightly. They could have made more accurate passes and create more chances, but were sloppy in their play-style. In the end, this was a huge disappointment for the top futbol nation."
They played a good game. They could have improved in areas of communication and dribbling but Ronaldo was able to lead the team to success. A good match overall.,They were horrendously terrible. They missed every opportunity that they had. They failed to make accurate passes. They failed to send balls into the penalty area and they made silly mistakes that allowed Switzerland to take advantage of them. An utter disappointment making many fans unhappy.
